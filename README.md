# Snake Game in Python

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, created using Python and the `uib_inf100_graphics` library for handling graphical output. The game allows you to control a snake, collect apples, and grow in size while avoiding collisions with walls or your own body.

## Features

- **Multiple Levels:** Choose between three levels: Small, Normal, and Large.
- **Snake Growth:** Each apple you collect will increase the snake's size, and your score will increase as well.
- **Game Over:** If the snake hits a wall or its own body, the game ends, and you can restart.
- **Debug Mode:** Toggle the debug mode to display the snake's position, size, and direction.
- **Keyboard Controls:**
  - `W` to move up
  - `S` to move down
  - `A` to move left
  - `D` to move right
  - `Space` to start the game or toggle debug mode
  - `Enter` to restart the game after game over
  - `1`, `2`, `3` to select the level


# Game Instructions
## Starting the Game:

Press Space to begin playing the game.

## Select a Level:

You will be presented with a menu to choose a level:
Press 1 for the Small level
Press 2 for the Normal level
Press 3 for the Large level

## Gameplay:

The snake starts at a predefined position on the board. Your goal is to collect apples, which will cause the snake to grow.
Use the arrow keys (W, S, A, D) to control the snake's movement.
Game Over:

The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own body. You can restart by pressing Enter.

## Debug Mode:

You can toggle the debug mode by pressing Q. When enabled, the current position, size, and direction of the snake will be displayed on the screen.

# How to Play
- Start the game by pressing the Space key.
- Use the W, S, A, and D keys to navigate the snake.
- Collect apples (represented by -1 on the board) to increase the snake's size and score.
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body. If you do, the game will end, and you can press Enter to restart.
